# Multi-layer Perceptron
MLP /MLP

## Multi-layer perceptron from scratch
This is a multi-layer perceptron from scratch applied to the MNIST data set based on the information found in the book
"Python Machine Learning" by Sebastian Raschka

**I'm trying to throughly understand how to use a MLP**

### Therefore:

- I have based myself on the code found on the book. 
- I tried explaining what everyline of code is doing, except for the obvious parts
- If something I have explained is wrong and/or I have miscomprehended the material, please let me know
- The MNIST test dataset is here to test the trained model
- the MLP was applied to the MNIST training set and tested with the MNIST testing set


The **training set** has 60k data points and the **testing set** has 10k data points.
